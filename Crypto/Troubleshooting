Important Notice: Privacy Level Settings in Power BI Desktop
When downloading and refreshing this report in Power BI Desktop, you may encounter a Formula.Firewall error. This is due to Power BI’s privacy level settings, which restrict combining data from different sources for security reasons.

To resolve this issue, you’ll need to adjust the Data Privacy settings in Power BI Desktop. Follow these steps:

Go to File > Options and settings > Options.
In the left-hand menu, select Privacy under the Global section.
Set Privacy Level to Ignore the Privacy Levels and Potentially Improve Performance.
Click OK to save your changes.
Disclaimer: Changing privacy levels may expose sensitive data if you are working with confidential information. Use this setting only if it aligns with your data security and privacy policies.

Alternatively, you can adjust the privacy level settings for individual data sources in Data Source Settings under the Home tab in Power Query, setting them to Public where possible and appropriate.
